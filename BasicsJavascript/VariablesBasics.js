// Hello this is a Basics Of Variables and Keywords used in the javascript.
let myName = "Rohit Rawat";
const myAge = 25;
mycity = "Delhi"; // this is not a good practice to use in hte programme. //
let Favcolour;
// const FavDestination; // this is not executable because const keyword always  need an intialization .

// myAge = 24;// Assignment to a constant Varibale is not Allowed in the javascript.
// prefer not to change the value of a constant varible.

myName = "Abhishek Rawat"; //This is Changable because it uses the let keyword.

console.log(myName);
console.log(myAge);
console.log(Favcolour); // This will show undefined because it is not assigned any value yet.

/*

let myAge; this is called the declaration ( Means telling compiler that a variable exists)
let myAge = 25; this is called initialization (Means giving a variable a first value at the time of decalration )
myAge = 24; this is called assignment ( means changing or giving the value to an existing variable)
